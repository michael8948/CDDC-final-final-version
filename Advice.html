                                            <p>Only on my second day of diving, I couldn’t equalize my ear pressure due
                                                to rhinitis. After several descending failures, I had to inflate my
                                                buoyancy control device and scented to the surface. That was
                                                disappointing but the real disaster was yet to come. By the moment I
                                                stuck my head out of the water, it was like two doors crushing my head
                                                and my nose felt like out of function. Oscar, my instructor from Spain,
                                                immediately took me to the dive shop and gave me a pillow and a can of
                                                gum which served as a temporary painkiller. I felt dizzy and was very
                                                much scared. It seemed the local taxi was blocked by the narrow street,
                                                so Oscar transported me with his little motorbike to the hospital. After
                                                several hours of observation, the doctor gave me some colorful bottles
                                                and warned me to rest for a few days.

                                                That night was a long night. The pain was killing me and since the
                                                inconvenience brought by rhinitis was inevitable, I was frustrated and
                                                wanted to give up. The next morning, Oscar came to visit me when the sun
                                                was about to rise. He wanted to check whether I was fine and worried
                                                that I would lose the interest. “You know, son, learning to dive is such
                                                a wonderful thing that I will never regret.” As the sun was rising from
                                                his back, he continued, “I hope you will get better and come back to the
                                                sea soon.” Then he gave me two days off and got on his little motorbike,
                                                leaving the warmth of morning sunshine to climb on my face.

                                                I recollected what I had seen under the sea. The corals with groups of
                                                unfamiliar fish, caves with clusters of sea hares inhabiting on the
                                                rocks, sea anemones with a family of clownfish (we call them Nemo
                                                because of the famous Disney movie: Finding Ne mo). All these gorgeous
                                                creatures gathered and established a world so different from the one on
                                                land. “You want to explore these magic territories.” A voice echoed in
                                                my head.

                                                Two days later, I went back to the dive shop where Oscar prepared a
                                                party to welcome my return. Then he elaborately selected four most
                                                impressive spots and four dives were done that day. We were exhausted
                                                yet we had a great time underwater. We witnessed tuna storm, turtle and
                                                groups of fish with teeth like human (later I found it’s termed
                                                Bolbometopon muricatum and listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened
                                                Species). At last, I took a picture with Oscar and bought a shirt from
                                                his dive shop. Suddenly a sense of gratefulness overwhelming my mind, I
                                                realized how much I love diving and how much I want to explore the
                                                beauty of nature. I mustn’t stop, I must move on.
